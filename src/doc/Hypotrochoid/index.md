# Hypotrochoid

A hypotrochoid is the trayectory described by a point attached to a given **circle** as it rolls *inside* a second fixed **circle**.

You can learn more about hypotrochoids in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocycloid) or [MathWorld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Hypocycloid.html).

## Hypocycloid equation

Mathematically, the trayectory of a hypocycloid is described by the following parameters:

- $R$: Radius of the fixed circle.

- $r$: Radius of the rolling circle.

- $p$: Distance from the center of the rolling circle to the tracing point.

The equation of a hypocycloid is:

$$
\begin{cases}
x = (R - r) \cos \theta + p \cos \left( \frac{R - r}{r} \theta \right) \\
y = (R - r) \sin \theta - p \sin \left( \frac{R - r}{r} \theta \right)
\end{cases}
$$

But this parametes are not the most intuitive to understand the shape of the hypocycloid. Instead, we will make the following simplifications:

- Fix the size of the fixed circle's radius: $R = 1000$.

- Rephrase the rolling circle's radius to a more intuitive and visual parameters:

  - Number of petals $n$: Number of cusps of the hypocycloid.

    This is a fancy way to describe the amount of full rotations the rolling circle has to do to **around itself** complete the trayectory.

  - Curliness $k$: This describes how much the petals are curled.

    This can be calculated by the relation between the fixed circle's radius and the rolling circle's radius, reducing the following fraction to its lowest terms:

    $$
    \frac{R}{r} = \frac{n}{k}
    $$

    where $n$ is the number full rotations the rolling circle has to do around itself to complete the trayectory, and $k$ is the number of full rotations the rolling circle has to do around the fixed circle to complete the trayectory.

- Petal size $s$: This is determined by the distance from the center of the rolling circle to the tracing point.

  So, parameters $p$ and $s$ are equivalent.

  In this project, this is limited to $0 \leq s \leq r$.

  This is because the same hypotrochoid can be generated by different values of $s$ and $r$ but with different zooms.
